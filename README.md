# DeepSeek Harness

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

DeepSeek Harness (`dsh`) is an open-source agent harness developed by [DeepSeek AI](https://deepseek.com).

It is built on an **everything-is-a-plugin** architecture and powered by [Cordis](https://github.com/cordiverse/cordis), whose design is described in [_A Programming Paradigm for Spatiotemporal Composability_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.25512).

This repository also contains the **spatial multi-agent shell** work: a lightweight desktop-oriented surface for running multiple agent CLIs as resident PTY sessions, arranging them in an adaptive mosaic, and coordinating them through the existing session, subagent, plugin, and Cordis extension surfaces.

## Developer preview

DeepSeek Harness is in _developer preview_ and iterating rapidly. **THERE WILL BE COMPATIBILITY-BREAKING CHANGES.**

Review the [safety notice](SAFETY.md) before running the project.

## Run

### Run from `npm`

Install `Node.js`, then run:

```sh
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web
```

The command starts the Web UI at `http://127.0.0.1:3080` by default and opens in the default browser for a local launch. An SSH launch only prints the host URL because the SSH client or editor owns the local forwarded address. Pass `--no-open` to run the server without opening a browser. See [Web UI guide](docs/user/guide/index.md).

### Run from source

To run from a repository checkout:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness.git
cd deepseek-harness
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm dsh web
```

`pnpm run build` prepares the repository artifacts. `pnpm dsh web` uses those built artifacts without rebuilding.

## Spatial multi-agent shell

The spatial shell keeps agent terminals resident in the application instead of treating each agent as a separate browser tab. Its client surface supports adaptive terminal tiling, focused/maximized views, workspace staging, and owner-scoped terminal control. The underlying PTY surface is exposed through the `terminal` Remote namespace so higher-level orchestration can create, inspect, message, delegate, stop, and continue agent work without bypassing session ownership.

### Release candidate

The spatial shell is validated as a release candidate only when the repository's static, coverage, consumer/snapshot, and cross-platform release gates are green on the exact PR head. The UI and PTY surface are intentionally kept thin so plugins and upstream Cordis extensions remain outside the core orchestration path.
